# Hi, It's Me!
Ummmm, I don't have that much to say, so have some Hello Worlds!

## Hello Worlds
### Java
```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
```
### Python/Lua
```py
print("Hello World!")
```
### C#
```cs
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```
### JavaScript
```js
console.log("Hello World!");
```
That's all... I think.
